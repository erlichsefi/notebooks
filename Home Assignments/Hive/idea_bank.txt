Idea:
- we are unsupervised but the task requires a topics.
- we will need first to divide the data into clusters and only then **manually** label them.
- comment: if we would like to automate only this part we can use LLM to label that cluster.
- Once we will have a labeled data we can create a classifier that can label the rest of the data.



Note:
- I've could have used LLM to label the data to topics but since i'm already paying with time, i would pay with money.
- I can use a mixsure of techniques to label the data.
